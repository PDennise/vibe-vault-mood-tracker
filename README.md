VibeVault -Mood Tracker-

## Project Overview
VibeVault is a terminal-based mood tracking application that allows users to log their daily emotions using free-text entries. The app performs sentiment analysis on the entries with TextBlob, stores mood data in a JSON file, and visualizes mood trends over time using matplotlib.

This tool aims to help users understand their emotional patterns and promote mindfulness through self-reflection.
